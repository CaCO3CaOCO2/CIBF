## "Study"  
Officially this is my first semester in humanities, which really is quite different from STEM. 
There are no more weekly problem sets and standardized exams. 
The weekly work becomes "required reading", which I gave up reading within a week after school began.
Course instructors tried (really hard) to engage students, interact and discuss, especially during tutorials.
Sometimes I felt a bit guilty, because I didn't do the readings and thus have not enough of material/ basic knowledge to contribute.
The worst part is when virtually _no_ _one_ did the readings, or maybe some were shy, that the whole class went into awkward silence mode. 
Occasionally the class would be on the day of deadlines for assignments, and everyone was doing other work instead of really attending the class.
So the teachers would just be left there hanging, which I don't know what we learn from it anymore. <br>


### Why do readings?  
Frustrated with myself, I asked two professors why would one do them. 
Both said, with some confused look on their face, that they enjoyed it.
Looking in hindsight I totally forgot the selection bias, where only those who enjoyed learning and 
are talented would become teachers at universities. 
To me, the readings has always been a burden instead of a blessing.
But still, their sharing encourages me to try shifting my perspective, to try finding the fun in it. <br>

### How to do readings?  
Only after the second semester began I realized I had been too cocky not to learn how to read.
Fortunately, some are kind enough to include a reading tutorial/ guide in my courses, which are super cool and helpful.
The steps could be as follows:
1. Identify the argument
2. See if the evidence build the argument strongly enough
3. Does, and if so, how the argument relates to/ contradicts other viewpoints <br>

I think what was different from learning from textbooks and past papers during my secondary school days, may be how we can "critique" the author's work, around one's argument.
But it makes me feel inferior, as while the author has all the expertise and knoweledge in his own research, I can only read and trust the detailed record is valid.
Particular if we consider how the contexts and concrete examples/cases matter towarding forming a strong argument, I am still a bit confused.  
Or maybe I can learn from the way authors form an argument with their evidence.  
In the end, I find myself more willing and interested to read if I have some kind of guide/ tutorial to follow;
it provides me with some tasks/ goals to achieve, instead of just wandering around in the passages. <br> 




#### Grades  
They are good enough. Definitely huge room for improvement tho. (Please do the readings)<br>
## Work  
The debt of my credit card has been creeping up on me, and often I am stressed because of it.
Combined this with my bad spending habits and I can easily set myself up to bankruptcy.
So I will do some more tutoring and see how that goes. Time management will be of utmost importance, especially if I am to balance between school and work.
And always try to enjoy some part of working.<br>
## Health  
Pretty bad. I think this took a huge toll on my school and work. Crying to sleep or until my eyes hurt most of the days really isn't an ideal situation.<br>
## People  
Made a friend or two, and realized finding those who match well is important.<br>

## Coming Up Next...?  
Get my health issues sorted out (for the most part), and do more focusing/ self-monitoring. Learn to get (at least) some fun of doing "boring" things,
such as going to class, doing grocery, or whatever. Work and start cleaning up the debt. Ask myself what I am thinking and how I am feeling more, and be grateful I am still living.
