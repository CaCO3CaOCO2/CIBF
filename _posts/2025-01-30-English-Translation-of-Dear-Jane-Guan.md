title: English Translation of Dear Jane - Guan (慣)
---

<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sdVyWg8Jmk0>  

_慣_(which means "Getting used to") is a song by a boyband called Dear Jane in Hong Kong. Here is my (beginner-level) translation.  


<br>翻開一張張舊相片  

Flipping open old photos one by one  

找到一套信件  

Found a set of letters  

漸漸熟習未能遇見  

Getting used to not meeting each other  

閉上眼都不必見面  

Don't need to see you even as I close my eyes  


<br>不想聽的歌在耳邊  

Song I don't want to hear is still ringing in my ears  

這賜教如磨練  

This lesson is such a grind  

學懂應該堅守信念  

Learnt to stand by my belief  

石沉大海必須擱淺  

Those that sink like a stone have to be left stranded  


<br>*要扮作灑脫 無奈這現實未免太絕  

Want to act casual  

but this reality is helplessly ending  

我不哭也不想説 但最終還被說穿  

I don't cry and don't want to say  

but in the end my bubble is popped  


<br>#我認我還未很慣 半夜裡無力支撐  

I admit I am still not used to it  

can't hang on in the nights  

人原來這麼的艱苦 都不應這樣慣  

Turns out it's so rough  

but still one should not be used to it  

我認我從未作反 臨完場這麼的慘淡  

I admit I have never rebelled  

why is it so bleak for me near the end of the game?  

孤單這類夜晚 顯得格外艱難    

Such lonely nights  

seems extra tough  

孤單我未很慣  

I am still not used to being lonely  


<br>一雙刀叉 一隻水杯  

One set of cutley  

one water cup  

一位出席晚會  

Only one showed up to the party  

儘管聲稱自由萬歲  

Even though I claimed "Long lived Freedom" 

勉強說得多都太累  

It's exhausting to forcefully talk too much  

Repeat * #  


<br>從明亮到漆黑  

From light to dark  

從存在到消失  

From existence to absence  

從此我認不慣  

From now on I confess I am still not used to it  

孤單這類夜晚  

Such lonely nights  

祈求別折返  

Please don't return anymore  

Repeat #
