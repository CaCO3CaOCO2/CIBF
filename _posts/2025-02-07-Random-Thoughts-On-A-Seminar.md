title: Random Thoughts On A Seminar

Here are just some very unorganized thoughts on a seminar I attended today, which is about family systems therapy in China.    

As predicted, it was full house with a lot of the professor's current and past students, and there is much vibrant energy in the room. The professor is such a natural talented speaker. She sounds confident and looks passionate. Very sociable, interacting with the front audience so easily. I kinda get jealous of both how she can articulate well and the friendliness shown. Is responsive in a nice way by always providing some kind of feedback, shows curiousity and patience when listening to others' questions.
  
<br>My brain has been on a slowed floaty mode since restarting Silexan, and it has to automatically change her voices into words for me to register meanings better. On the bright side, it is way less noisy or loud than usual.   
  
  There are some interesting ideas I learn.
One is the concept of triangulation from Murray Bowen . It is about using a third person (outsider) to alleivate the tension between two people talking. One example is gossiping about the other guy during conversations.   
 Another example is when a kid(patient) was asked what she was unsatisfied with her parents, she complained about her mum not washing dishes properly. The analysis is that the kid complains on behalf of her dad, sort of like taking up the father's role in this case.  
  
  There is also the super cool one, about the assumptions of one having his own feelings.
Some theory may suggest that emotions flowing around between people instead, like nodes in a circuit.
The fun part is when the researcher breaks such assumption during the process.
  
  Often, a part of audience will nod or make the "mm-hmm" sounds when a point is made, all while I am still floating in the sounds of bird chirpings or processing. And it feels a bit worrying sometimes.
Overall, this seminar is the kind that reminds me of how I know very very little about this world, and how interesting explorations can be.
