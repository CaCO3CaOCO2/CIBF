It's night now and I am sleepy, so this is just some random thoughts (that are probably not constructive at all).    

The major I am in is infamous for bleak career prospects. It's one of those that you can basically do anything (professional jobs excluded of course) after graudation (which essientially means nothing). I plan to defer and stay at uni until year 5, but even as a year 3 right now I feel the pressure mounting. Part-time tutoring that I have been doing is not secure nor stable.  

Putting worries about work aside for a moment, let's talk about schoolwork.

The thing about doing humanities is that gradings are very subjective compared to STEM bachelor degrees. The line between good and mediocre work is so vague. And even if you did all the readings and showed up to classes and contributed, what would you achieve with the As?  
How could you convince others that you really did write something interesting/ meaningful, instead of simply being lucky that the professor is in a nice mood when marking the paper or likes you?    
Maybe one could pick up some analytical or communication skills on the way, but what could he/she do with the substances learnt throughout the courses?  
This I would have to figure out... And before that, I will at least try to do the readings and (hopefully) learn something during this semester.   

<br> I will get some more information during this process, then dive into job market sooner or later. [The abyss is to be stared.](https://www.benkuhn.net/abyss/)
