title: How and Why Anthropologists Study the Illicit

We will inevitably do something outside of the “mainstream narrative”, no matter how hard we try to fit in. When someone does something out of the appropriate context (like picking the nose in the restaurant), we can’t help but feel weirded by it. Such act counts as illicit. Then, why do anthropologists study the illicit? What can we learn from it?

Recently I stumbled upon a [post](https://www.threads.net/@tszlttang/post/C-ic7A6h2EO) on social media. It is about a citizen who complained about 3 MTR staff, in bright red vests, standing on both sides of the escalator and holding signs to tell people stand firm on either side when he/ she was in a hurry. It sparked discussions, as some thought one should have better time management instead of complaining about the policy, while some condemned the MTR jobs being ‘useless’. 
<br><br>
As I look more into it, MTR [used]( https://www.carousell.com.hk/p/%E9%83%AD%E5%AF%8C%E5%9F%8E-%E6%9E%97%E6%B5%B7%E5%B3%B0-%E8%91%9B%E6%B0%91%E8%BC%9D-%E8%BB%9F%E7%A1%AC%E5%A4%A9%E5%B8%AB%EF%BD%9E93%E5%B9%B4%EF%BD%9Emtr%E5%AE%A3%E5%82%B3%E5%BB%A3%E5%91%8A%EF%BD%9E%E9%9B%9C%E8%AA%8C%E5%BD%A9%E9%A0%81%EF%BD%9E-253232166/) to ask people to stand only on the right side to be a polite passenger in 1993. I think about how I usually take the escalator, and what I observed: some people and I frequently walked on the left, and most always only stood on the right. I also notice that nowadays MTR has advertisements telling people to stand on either side for safety and change their habit. 
Besides, according to [Mass Transit Railway By-laws](https://www.elegislation.gov.hk/hk/cap556B), “no person shall ascend or descend, or attempt to ascend or descend, by means of any escalator other than in such manner and order as is directed by the (MTR) Corporation”. This implies that many are already breaking the law, which constitutes illicit.
However, the social norm of ‘walk on the left and stand on the right’ is still being perpetuated.  
  
This reflects the contradiction: it is against the law walking on the left of escalator but aligns with the social norm. It also shows the ambiguity: although it is against the law, the citizens, who are supposed to be law abiding, don’t follow MTR’s instructions when using the escalator, yet I have never heard of one being fined for walking on the left. 

There were several times that I noticed a middle-aged/ elder person would stand on the left, with people behind he/she clearly wanting to get pass and walk on the escalator (by literal verbal means, facial expressions or body language). The person blocking would acknowledge the fact and _ignore_ it. Then the whole left lane would be stuck in a traffic jam. 
Some commented in the original post that they would even swear at those who stood on the escalator or even shove them when in a hurry. But I have never seen that happen in real life. 

If we put aside another meaning of “illicit”, that is “breaking the law”, and focus on the “not being mainstream” in this example, there could be some insights.
The meat of something being illicit is its non-mainstreamness: that MOST people don’t do the illicit thing. But the interesting part is when the paradigm shifts, and the illicit becomes mainstream, with the original mainstream thing becoming illicit.
In this case, it is MTR actively trying to change the common practice and people’s behaviour that sparks some heated discussion online. Will walking on the escalators in Hong Kong ever become illicit?

It also reveals how the illicit is always context-sensitive; that how one thing is acceptable in one culture may totally be viewed as peculiar or weird. Some search online shows ([here](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7dY21adLovA),  [here](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/VUTswHA4Fug) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/L0Ymb5I9tsI)) how people stand on both sides casually in India. Even if they walk on escalators, there usually isn't a particular "walk on left, stand right" unspoken rule enforced.


In Gordon Matthew’s book, _Ghetto at the Center of the World: Chungking Mansions, Hong Kong_, he mentioned an example of competing phone stalls between the Indians and Pakistanis. The Indian, under the pressure of his customers getting swayed away from his business and to the Pakistanis, lowered the price as best as he could. This unfortunately resulted in being threaten by the Pakistani Muslims. The Indian’s telling the police about the illegal workers in the Pakistani shops didn’t work in revenge successfully, as they were given a day off, when the shop owner saw such potential retaliation coming.
Even when the Pakistanis later gave him sweets in seek of peace, the Indian refused, worrying about being poisoned. He ended up defusing the situation with the religious proposal, which was about taking each other’s son to their temples and receiving judgements.

We can turn shared knowledge in a culture into common knowledge: that is, make something that everybody (within in particular sphere) knows into “knowledge of others’ knowledge, knowledge of their knowledge of one’s knowledge, ad infinitum”. In other words, common knowledge is “I know you know I know (to infinity) that...”.

What MTR is doing here, hiring workers standing on the left, and holding up signs, turns their advice/ regulations that one should not walk on the escalators into public knowledge; everyone should and needs to know this.
What an anthropological perspective and analysis can do, then, is show the process of public knowledge becoming common knowledge: people know others know that they, by common practice, custom, and culture, don’t or “shouldn’t” stand on left. Yet they sustain.   

Through studying the illicit, we can see how conflicts emerge and how peace is made.
How the Pakistani avoided to be caught by the police worked similarly: they knew the Indian knew they were hiring illegal workers. 
The Pakistani’s candy giving make the message public: we are trying to make peace! And the Indian, knowing this, proposed a religious solution. (I know you want to make peace.) Although it wasn’t taken up, his acquiring of common knowledge eventually settles the matter. (I know you know I want to make peace.)
  
Successful coordination and mutual gain [rely](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/uncommon-insights-into-common-knowledge) on common knowledge. But examples show simply having common knowledge doesn’t necessarily mean cooperation. What anthropologists can do, then, is ask questions like: “Do I really know?” “Do you know?” or “Do you know I know?”. And if all answers are positive, they may consider throwing softball questions that can satisfy wonders of “Then why do you do that?”, to see how people make sense of their world.
