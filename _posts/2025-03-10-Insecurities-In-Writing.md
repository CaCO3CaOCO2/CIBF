When you realise you just don't have the writer's flow, the meat or the juice to put up good work. Where has it gone? Do I have to be cramming for deadlines just so ideas will finally come up?  

I am insecure and disappointed with poor work. Superficial analysis sucks.  

What's worse, I worry I just don't have talent/ skill in thinking and writing.  

What if my whole life is just spent thinking and writing about stupid, meaningless, trivial things? What kind of interesting, novel points do I really have? What if I actually have none?
Or is this just another bottom for me to hit? Is there hope for me to bounce back up?  

I just can’t, I can’t get into the flow, the feeling of ideas springing up and flowing. The work has been juiceless, choppy and without a soul. (This is not because of my taking the meds, right?)  

Yes, practice makes perfect, or at least you will hopefully get better at it. But writing is not only about style, but substance. What substance do I really have that's not boringly braindead?  

Oh and don't get me start on Iq and talents. (I have low Iq and have no idea what my so called talent is.)
