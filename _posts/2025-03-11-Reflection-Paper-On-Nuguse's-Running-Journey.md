title: Reflection Paper On Nuguse's Running Journey

How would you critically analyse positive news in Sociology or in Anthropology?  

The short answer is: you don’t. Or maybe with talent, you could do a fantastic job out of it, but I can’t. Yet.
So here is me forcing to spit out 1400 words, only to realize how juiceless, trivial and boring it is, then decided to scrap it and rewrite the whole thing with another piece of news instead.  

The recent news report I picked is about [Yared Nuguse’s journey in middle- distance running] (https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/05/sport/yared-nuguse-running-spt-intl/index.html). It talks about how Nuguse went from a “scrawny” teen, whose the only sports he cared about is bowling, to an elite runner

Reflecting on this article, I will analyse the news and connect it to various topics, including the modernization of sports and different sociological approaches and theories, such as the conflict theory and agency theories.

In the photo of celebrating his victory at the Zurich Diamond League, Nuguse smiled, holding the laurel leaf in his hand and the U.S. national flag behind his back. While the leaf still dates back to Apollo, about Greek mythology, tradition and culture, the race is no longer as crude as before.


Entering modernity, the development of sports has not left running behind.

Modern sports is characterized by accurate standardisation; the extreme precision and quantifying data.  For example, the news mentioned how Nuguse broke the world record with a time of 3:46.63, which the time is measure in precise terms of hundredths of a second. No wonder Omega, the famous high-end watch company sponsored the race at the Zurich Diamond League, as shown in the photo.


I also took note of the photo, captioned “Hocker edged out Kerr and Nuguse to win 1,500m gold at the Paris Olympics last year.”. It was taken aerially, right on top of the goal line, above the athletes, capturing how Nuguse barely missed it and ended up with a bronze medal. The difference in timing between Kerr and Nuguse's line crossing is so small that it is difficult for the human eye to catch.



These show how it's all about detailed measurement with heavy use of technology in the modern sports, to decide and record race results. The difference in timing between Kerr and Nuguse's line crossing is so small that it is difficult for the human eye to catch.


I also found Nuguse’s Olympics voyage like rite of passage in some sense. After the gun shot and he was racing against others in Paris, he entered liminality. As it was announced that Nuguse was the third place, he completed the rite of passage, gaining a new social status of a bronze medalist in the Olympics, which carries a lot of honour and fame. This stage is marked by the awards ceremony.


CNN's report of Nuguse’s story fits well to the functionalist approach. 


For example, it said “his achievements on the track are testament to his enormous talent and work ethic”, and mentioned Nuguse being driven and determined. Here, running is framed to be building character. Looking into his subjective experience, Nuguse said his instinct to take the race, running on a track with others, seriously cultivated and grew in him, shaping him to be a competitive person. He really “let it all out on the track.” It has become a way of letting the competitiveness grow and show in a proper and appropriate way, and letting the steam out.


Running, as a sport, is also a motivation for him to become better and improve himself through hard work, “go for it the best he could”. Nuguse believes he can beat anyone, including other top athletes.


The article also displayed how news media and society emphasize high level of achievement, attainment, and output. It is important to note how the news reporter spent a good part on Neguse’s medals and world breaking record.


From the point of view of conflict theorists, this generates and reinforces the common belief that success can only be achieved through hard work and hard work always brings success, implicitly putting the blame on those who lose or fail for being lazy in the modern individualistic society.



The focus of Nuguse’s work ethic also reminds me of what I learnt in class, where sports can be viewed as a site to select those who are disciplined and determined, instead of so called 'nuturing' future talents with characters and virtues.  


In the case against high-school sports, Ripley (2013) said “Athletics succeeded in distracting not just students but entire communities.”, especially as sports become important to the school.


I believe Nuguse would probably agree with the fact that sports sidelined his school work,but  disagree with the argument of getting rid of sports in high schools. It is through physical education in school and his high school coach, not club teams, for the then ‘scrawny’ teenager to stumble upon running and realize his love within. While he indeed got sidetracked by running from his dream of becoming a dentist, he expressed no regrets but felt fortunate instead. As Nuguse said, running professionally was luckily more of a calling to him than dental school at that moment, as he reckoned he could go back to school later. While Nuguse was “distracted” from academics by sports, after discovering his passion for running at high school, he really enjoyed the process. And according to him, it built his character.


Policy in Britain back then claimed that sport can bond people across national borders while paradoxically representing ‘nationhood’. 


From the article, only the latter part is true. Nuguse, representing his homeland, held the U.S. national flag when he took pictures after winning. Furthermore, at the World Athletics Championships, athletes’ vests are printed with the name of their country.  This shows clues of nationalism.


On the other hand, examples from this news report didn’t show signs of sports bonding people from different countries. Instead, Josh Kerr (ironically an athlete from the Great Britain), and Jakob Ingebrigtsen, another elite from Norway, have been having verbal “clash”, with Kerr regarding Ingebrigtsen’s comments as “disrespectful”. He also said “we (Ingebrigtsen and I) don’t like each other.” Rather than bonding, the athletes representing two countries are having “real beef”.



This links back to seeing sports from a conflict theory approach. Nuguse’s holding of the national flag shows how sports is the showplace for displaying national symbols, eventually showing off the “soft power” of the country. Kerr and Ingebrigtsen running against each other also provides model of confrontation, while athletes are categorized and polarized by their countries.


To look deeper at Nuguse’s running journey in different ways, I will analyze it through both the agency and structure theories.


Structure theories, which hold the notion that our actions are determined by social forces and social structures, focuses on the social relationships, and links between social structures. It fits pretty well into Nuguse’s case. He joined his high school mile race to get an A in PE. His teacher persuaded him to join the track team after looking at his time. Nuguses got convinced.


Why did young Nuguse want an A so bad? It’s just a letter. This is likely because good grades symbolize and signal virtues to colleges and employers in the future. Social force pushed he into running the race. Moreover, the teacher didn’t exclude him or ignore his result because of Nuguse’s skin colour and gave him a chance. This shows how social relationships bring about changes.

 
In the meantime, the agency theories, which propose an agent can choose freely how to act, emphasizes how individuals create and give meanings.



In this case, Nuguse did run as he would, and personally made the choice to join the team. As he advanced in the world of running, he broke records and represented his country in the Paris Olympics. He even becomes the star in this news report, possibly inspiring other potential young runners. He has individually made historical running record and leave a legacy.


On the other hand, structure theories play a role here too. Noting the relationships between social structures and insitituions, such as watch companies sponsoring races and running organizations, there is no doubt that they help create an environment for talents like Nuguse to thrive and perform on the track. Were there little to no race, and no technology companies that help provide racing results, Nuguse would not enjoy so many opportunities to race, let alone being able to run professionally. This shows how social structures play a significant role in Nuguse’s running life.


I have looked into running and Nuguse’s journey from different angles. 


(Modern sport was capitalism at play, and for Nuguses, he is deep in the game running.) &larr; What kind of ending is this??
